Tensor decompositions and examples

Important Links
===============
- Official source code repo: https://github.com/tensorlib/tensorlib
- HTML Documentation (WIP): http://tensorlib.github.io

Setup
=====

The HTML docmentation linked above has a variety of resources for installation
and example use. To get started immediately, clone this repo then do:

``python setup.py develop``

When using the examples, some datasets will be downloaded.
The default directory for this is ``$HOME/tensorlib_data``.

The key packages required are:
    * numpy
    * scipy

and a soft dependency on matplotlib for the examples. 

Documentation is sparse but we are working to improve unclear modules. Feel
free to raise issues on
`GitHub <https://github.com/tensorlib/tensorlib>`_
with any problems found!
